<p id="intro"> 
    Myself Harshdeep Singh, a technocrat who loves technology, since childhood.<br>
    I currently reside in a beautiful town named Vernon in heart of British Columbia. <br>
    I love my cup of coffee and love to play football, (only if I win). <br>
    I recently completed my Computer Science studies from a very generic college, <br>
     I believe Udemey and Coursera taught me more than those 2 years. <br>
     For living I do three things: Eat, Sleep, Code, <br> Entertainment, Talking to family and friends, doing grocerries, breathing, walking and more... <br> 
     Next time someone says they do only three things to live, do not believe them! <br>
     Please do not mind my humor, I watch VSauce on name of entertainment (Google search is ready for you here!) <br>
